# Swiss

Swiss is my attempt to help the user easily lay out markdown content to a magazine-style layout. I have been heavily inspired by flipboard over the last few years, but there has been no such tool to help lay out content for the web. 

## What the end-user would be able to see/do?

The workflow for the end-user will be: 
1. Select the layout per page
1. Insert and size the media content into the layout

The algorithm should then fill up the pages with the text appropriately. The text flowing will be done using a phantomjs instance on a nodejs server
